# FMCG-Analysis

This project, implemented in R, is an Analysis of a FMCG Dataset.

The data set is from the FMCG domain and following are the key points:

* Consists of 2500+ variants manufactured by many, from many brands and sub-brands, having one or more primary benefits for one or more body-parts.

* For each instance of the variant, there are Volume sales, Revenue and No of Stores for all months of three years â€“ 2011, 2012 and 2013.

* Additionally, there is another data set that consists of Media spends of Two particular variants for one and half years.

A major player in this segment is "brand-311" along with its variant "variant-734". It is of interest to understand how this variant is affecting sales of "variant-1163". Therefore, this project focussed on performing supplementors and competitors analysis.
